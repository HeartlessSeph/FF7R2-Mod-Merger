# FF7R2-Mod-Merger
Merges FF7 Rebirth Text files and DataObjects in mod files. Source not yet posted as there's a lot of cleanup to be done.

This requires the FF7 Rebirth branch of retoc and LongerWarrior's FF7 Rebirth branch of UAssetGUI. Ensure that you select the retoc exe and not the retoc wrapper. Mods listed higher in the file list are given more priority when merging. Change the order by dragging them. Some mods may not properly unpack but I have made some efforts to be able to unpack mods that aren't supported by retoc unpacking by default.
